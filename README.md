This repository contains code for "MemGuard: Defending against Black-Box Membership Inference Attacks via Adversarial Examples". 

Required python tool (under Ubuntu 16.04): Python 2.7 (or 3.6), Keras (2.2.2), TensorFlow 1.8.0 (as we compute gradient, different backend may have different implementation, you maybe need to check the backend), numpy(1.13.3), argparse (1.1), scipy (1.2.0). GPU support (you can also comment related code if not using GPU). 



# Dataset description: 

data/location contains the location dataset from the paper: "Membership Inference Attacks Against Machine Learning Models". You may consider citing this paper if you use this dataset. 

# Code usage: 


input_data_class.py is used to input the data needed for all other modules.

config.ini maintains the configuration for the experiments such as the hyperparameters. 

model folder contains the file that defines the machine learning models which include target model, attack model, and defense model. 

train_user_classification_model.py is used to train target model. 

train_defense_model_defensemodel.py is used to train defense model. 

defense_framework.py implements our defense algorithm. 

train_attack_shadow_model.py is used to train attacker's shadow model.

evaluate_nn_attack.py is used to evaluate the NN-Attack. 


You can directly run run_location_defense.py (python run_location_defense.py) after installing python tools. It will automatically run the pipeline. 

We also run the code and obtain the following result: (similar to Figure 1 in MemGuard paper). 

Distortion budget: [1.0, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.0]

Inference accuracy: [0.50, 0.52, 0.55, 0.62, 0.69, 0.73]
